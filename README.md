## Intro

Hi! My name is Jonathan Kim, and this was a coding project created for the first coding assignment for CS 498 Game Dev at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in Fall 2021. It involves a very simple endless runner type game. See https://illinois-cs498gd.github.io/assignments/mp1.html for more details.
